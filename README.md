Simple Triangle Mesh Processor.

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sgrottel/meshproc)](LICENSE)

This project does not want to provide a ton of different functions,
but only important core functions with optimized implementations.
It's not aiming to replace [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad) or [MeshLab](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab).
It's aiming to complement those in a greater processing pipeline.

## Development & Work-In-Progress Notes:

### Senarios

- load multiple meshes, place them, save one combined mesh
- automatically remove non-manifold geometry
- automatically close (small) holes
- cut in holes
- stitch mesh holes
- partially morph/blend meshes (create seamless connections) and merge meshes by re-meshing
- free deform meshes with a tri-linear, tri-quadratic, or tri-cubic volume
- shear and tighten meshes
- select vertices, faces, edges
- break edges (and corners)
- Later: spring-mass-sim deformation
  -> Golem
  -> Skeletor
  -> ...

### Concept
- Manual live interaction
- Action script is automatically built&synced, saved, loaded and replayed, etc.
- 3d view based on an engine, e.g. Godot or helix?
